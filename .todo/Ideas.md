# Ideas

## Would be cool now

- Provide content delivery mode:
  - Depth first (current one)
  - Breadth first
  - Mixed (select for each level)
- Provide different depth materialization styles:
  - Indentation (current one)
  - TextStyle hierarchy
  - Visible boxes (outline, background, mixâ€¦)

## Someday
- When on the last step of a slide, show a hint (e.g. a camera emoji or icon), to let people know it's time to take a picture before the content goes away.
  - Could be more explicit than blurred elements
- Add chapter closing option
